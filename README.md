# PackPal
PackPal is a simple, beginner-friendly web application designed to help groups organize packing for trips or events. It allows users to create shared checklists where each item can be assigned to a specific person in the group. Using unique URLs (like ?list=abc123), users can share these checklists with others, making it easy for everyone to collaborate and track progress in real time. The app is built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Supabase handling the backend data storage and syncingâ€”no Node.js or SQL knowledge required. PackPal is lightweight, accessible, and perfect for small group trips, hackathons, or event planning.
